Build, embed, and manage beautiful forms right in WordPress

== Description ==
With the new Typeform plugin for WordPress, you can easily access your Typeform workspace, browse forms you’ve already made or create your own, and embed them on your website. Download the plugin and say hello to a smoother workflow!

= Turn visitors into customers with stand-out forms =
Typeform’s one-question-at-a-time interface feels more like a conversation—and gets higher response rates as a result. We make collecting leads, recommending products, growing your contact list, gathering feedback, registering signups, and answering common questions simple for you and enjoyable for your visitors.

Upload logos, set color palettes, and create themes everyone on your team can use. You can customize your font, background, images, and videos to match your brand for a seamlessly integrated experience.

= Customize and optimize forms with AI =
Get more answers by asking better questions. Typeform's AI will draw on experience and best practices to perfect your language on the fly. Our AI will automatically draft questions and recommend features for your forms based on the kind of insights you need.

= Integrate with your favorite tools =
* With 120+ integrations and Zapier, you're able to send information where you need it.
* Connect with CRMs, including Salesforce, Hubspot, Mailchimp, Active Campaign, Zoho, Pipedrive, and more
* Trigger workflows across your tech stack with automation platforms like Zapier and Make
* Notify your team about responses in real-time with collaboration tools such as Slack, Airtable, monday.com, and more

------------
> **Important**
> This plugin is for embedding forms created over at Typeform. You can’t edit them or see responses inside WordPress.
> This plugin is incompatible with WordPress 4 together with the Gutenberg editor. If you need support for WordPress 4, please use [version 0.7.5](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/typeform.0.7.5.zip).

== Privacy ==
Using this plugin you agree to the Typeform terms and conditions. You can read more about how we manage user data at Typeform [on our website](https://admin.typeform.com/to/dwk6gt/?typeform-source=wordpress.org).
When installing this plugin, we do not track any of your personal data, we only track some anonymous information about the usage of the plugin, in order to give to the WordPress community a better user experience.

== Upgrade Notice ==
Please keep the latest version of the Typeform Plugin in use on your WordPress site for improved security and the latest features.
We'll keep upgrading the plugin as Typeform gets better and better. Join our [community]((https://community.typeform.com/share-your-typeform-6)) for top tips, and to give your feedback.
If you are upgrading from a version of this plugin prior to 1.0.0, your forms will appear as shortcodes in the editor. It will render the form on your website pages, however to edit your forms you will need to re-embed them with the new Gutenberg block plugin.

== Screenshots ==
1. Click on the page where you'd like to place the typeform and type /typeform.
2. Decide how you’d like to create a new form, or select and embed an existing one.
3, Customize how you'd like your form to appear on WordPress.
